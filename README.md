# Caffeine Quant | Dual-Core Execution Engine

> **"We do not predict. We calculate."**

**Caffeine Quant** is an institutional-grade algorithmic trading infrastructure bridging the gap between retail capital and HFT technologies.

Unlike traditional bots that rely on static indicators, our engine utilizes a **Dual-Core Neural Architecture**:
1.  **Primary Core (Gemini 1.5 Pro):** Scans market structure, sentiment, and liquidity vectors in real-time.
2.  **Risk Core (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):** Acts as a "Board of Directors," cross-validating every trade signal to filter out false positives with strict skepticism.

* **Latency:** Sub-50ms execution via direct exchange API uplinks (AsyncIO).
* **Smart Guard™:** Dynamic risk management protocol that mathematically preserves capital during volatility spikes.
* **Phoenix Protocol:** Automated position recovery and re-calibration algorithms.
